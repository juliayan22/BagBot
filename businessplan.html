<h1>Business Plan</h1>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Our mission is to facilitate getting around by creating a robot to carry baggage. This will both reduce traffic and give people extra time to do what they want. This also can improve security, be faster and more efficient.</p>
</center>
<div style= "margin:20px">
<p>This means that we want to help airport traffic by creating robots that did luggage. This would make things faster for many reasons. One of those many reasons is that this can improve security speed. We can attach a security scanner to the Bagbot, making security better and faster because they don't need to scan suitcases anymore. We plan on extending that into much much more. For example, we can add carts to instead of bring luggage, carry humans to their destinations.</p>

<h2>Organizational Structure</h2>
<h2>Long Term Growth</h2>
</center>
<p>Our company was founded in 2014 by cofounders Sarah Kobayashi and Julia Yan. It all started out when our founders had just missed their plane because one of the wheels on their luggage had broken off. After, while going home Julia had a miraculous idea: “What if we could make a robot that would take your luggage in the airport and deliver it to your terminal? “That would be awesome!” She quickly told her friend Sarah about her idea. She thought it was an amazing idea too. They decided to start a company!
</p>
<div style= "margin:20px">
<p>Now, their company is running great. There are many employees such as Heloise Boeuf and Stanley Liu who work full time and they are the VP of marketing and VP of sales. Their are also a lot of who work part time. We have currently made the BagBot and are working on another robot.

<div style= "margin:20px">
<b>S</b>
We have a very talented crew of engineers and scientists
We are already starting to produce robots for over 10 airports
We are teaming up with QBotix to make our robots more efficient with solar power
</div>
<div style= "margin:20px">
<b>W</b>
We do not have very many advertisements
Our materials are limited
We do not have very many investors
Installation of monorails for transportation of BagBot may be lengthy and inconvenient for the airport
</div>
<div style= "margin:20px">
<b>O</b>
We are a blooming company with new technology
We are a startup company with many future investment partnership plans
</div>
<div style= "margin:20px">
<b>T</b>
With rising competitors like iRobot and Touch Bionics funding for money has become harder
We are lacking angel investors
