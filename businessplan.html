<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
</div>
<p>“Our mission is to facilitate getting around by creating a robot to carry baggage. This will both reduce traffic and give people extra time to do what they want. This also can improve security, be faster and more efficient. ”</p>
<div style= "margin:40px">
<p>This means that we want to help airport traffic by creating robots that did luggage. This would make things faster for many reasons. One of those many reasons is that this can improve security speed. We can attach a security scanner to the Bagbot, making security better and faster because they don't need to scan suitcases anymore. We plan on extending that into much much more. For example, we can add carts to instead of bring luggage, carry humans to their destinations.</p>
