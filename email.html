				Our company has been working for a long time to produce the most efficient robot in the market. We are creating a robot that will carry around your luggage in the airport so you wonâ€™t need to worry about it. It has many great features including a security band that is only unlockable by using your thumbprint. It also has lots of support and can carry up to 100 pounds of baggage.

				To complete our goal, we ask for a kind donation of $3,000,000. We will use this donation for materials and advertisement. In three years you can expect 30% equity.

				If you are interested in this opportunity, please send us an email.

		The BagBot team
