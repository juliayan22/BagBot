	      Stanley is a rising seventh grader who enjoys eating donuts. He was motivated to work on BagBot by the widely-shared dislike for carrying luggage. His magnificent writing and coding have contributed immensely to the progress of the group.

	      Rising 6th grader Sarah may be small, but her energy and work ethic are definitely not. She has contributed to the code and email, but her most remarkable activities were on the creation of the iMovie. Aside from BagBot, she enjoys gymnastics.

	      Heloise was not around for the development of the product idea, but her willingness to jump in and work on an unfamiliar project has impressed everybody. Her skills came through in the creation of the ad, as she was a lively actress and scriptwriter and added spirited edge to the creation.
